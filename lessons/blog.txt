o	Allow us to start using the data, before it has finish loading(before it has been fully read). i.e. Hence reading large file takes time; instead of waiting until the file is fully read, we can fetch small batch of data called “buffers” at a time and we start working on the arrived batch immediately until the next batch arrives. 
o	 For example, when you watch movie on Netflix or YouTube; a little bit of data is sent to the browser, so that you can start watching immediately without having to wait the for the whole video to load.
